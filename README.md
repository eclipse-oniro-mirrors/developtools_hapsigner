# hapsigner

## Introduction

To ensure that all apps and binary tools (such as lldb-server) come from a known and approved source and have not been tampered with, OpenHarmony requires that all executable code be signed. Only signed apps and binary tools can be installed, run, and debugged on real devices.

The repository provides the source code of the signing tool named hapsigner, which provides the functions such as generating a key pair, a certificate signing request (CSR), or a certificate, and signing a profile, a Harmony Ability Package (HAP), or a binary tool.
The mandatory code signing mechanism provides validity check and integrity protection for apps in runtime, eliminating execution of malicious code on devices and malicious tampering of app code by attackers.

Code signing is enabled by default for hapsigner. If you do not need the mandatory code signing feature, you can disable it as required. Currently, hapsigner supports code signing only for apps in hap format and binary tools.

## Constraints
- The hapsigner tool is developed in Java and must run in JRE 8.0 or later.
- The scripts, such as the one-click signing script, are developed in Python, and must run on Python 3.5 or later.

## Build

 1. Check that Gradle 7.1 has been installed.

        gradle -v

 2. Download the code, open the directory **developtools_hapsigner/hapsigntool**, and run the following command to build the code:

        gradle build or gradle jar

 3. Check that **hap-sign-tool.jar** (binary files) is generated in the **./hap_sign_tool/build/libs** directory.


## Usage
### Files Related to Signing

When signing an app using the IDE, you will obtain the following files from the SDK:

```
KeyStore (KS) file: OpenHarmony.p12
Profile signing certificates: OpenHarmonyProfileRelease.pem and OpenHarmonyProfileDebug.pem
Profile templates: UnsgnedReleasedProfileTemplate.json and UnsgnedDebugProfileTemplate.json
Signing tool: hap-sign-tool.jar
```
The figures below illustrate how these files are used.

### Usage Guidelines

In the following, the .jar package is the binary files built.

#### Using Commands
You can use commands to sign a profile and a HAP or binary tool.

1. Sign a profile.


```shell
java -jar hap-sign-tool.jar  sign-profile -keyAlias "oh-profile1-key-v1" -signAlg "SHA256withECDSA" -mode "localSign" -profileCertFile "result\profile1.pem" -inFile "app1-profile-release.json" -keystoreFile "result\ohtest.jks" -outFile "result\app1-profile.p7b" -keyPwd "123456" -keystorePwd "123456"
```
The parameters in the command are described as follows:

    sign-profile: Sign a provisioning profile.
         ├── -mode              # Signing mode, which can be localSign or remoteSign. It is mandatory.
         ├── -keyAlias          # Key alias. It is mandatory.
         ├── -keyPwd            # Key password. It is optional.
         ├── -profileCertFile   # Profile signing certificate (certificate chain, in the end-entity certificate, intermediate CA certificate, and root certificate order). It is mandatory.
         ├── -inFile            # Provisioning profile to be signed. It is mandatory.
         ├── -signAlg           # Signing algorithm, which can be SHA256withECDSA or SHA384withECDSA. It is mandatory.

```
The parameters in the command are described as follows:

#### Performing One-Click Signing


To improve development efficiency, this project also provides scripts for one-click signing. You can use the scripts to easily generate a key pair or an end-entity certificate and sign a profile, HAP, or binary tool without entering complex commands.
The following scripts and configuration files are located in the **autosign** directory:

 - create_root.sh/create_root.bat
 - create_appcert_sign_profile.sh/create_appcert_sign_profile.bat
 - sign_hap.sh/sign_hap.bat
 - sign_elf.sh/sign_elf.bat
 - createAppCertAndProfile.config
 - createRootAndSubCert.config
 - signHap.config
 - signElf.config

**Procedure**
1. Check that Python 3.5 or later is available.
2. Obtain **hap-sign-tool.jar**. For details, see section **Build**.
3. Check that the HAP, binary tool, or provisioning profile to be signed is available.
4. Use the text editor to open **createAppCertAndProfile.config**, **signElf.config**, and **signHap.config** and change the values of **common.keyPwd** and **common.issuerKeyPwd** to match your case.
5. Run **create_appcert_sign_profile.sh** on Linux or **create_appcert_sign_profile.bat** on Windows to generate the files required for signing.
6. Run **sign_hap.sh** on Linux or **sign_hap.bat** on Windows to sign the HAP. Run **sign_elf.sh** on Linux or **sign_elf.bat** on Windows to sign the binary tool.

 > **NOTE**
 >
 > To generate a KS file, root CA certificate, intermediate CA certificate, and profile signing certificate, perform the following steps:
 1. Use the text editor to open the **createRootAndSubCert.config** file and change the values of **common.keyPwd** and **common.issuerKeyPwd** to match your case.
 2. Run **create_root.sh** on Linux or run **create_root.bat** on Windows to generate the required KS file, root CA certificate, intermediate CA certificate, and profile signing certificate.
